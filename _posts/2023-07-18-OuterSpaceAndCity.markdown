description: What are space telecommunication infrastructures used for and by whom?  </br> Outer Space and the City investigates the reciprocal tensions and relations between interplanetary infrastructures of telecommunication and urbanization. Embedded in cities in the form of mission control rooms, data centers, and cell phone towers, interplanetary infrastructures of telecommunications provide the means to condition, monitor, activate, enable, and/or foreclose specific forms of urban life. How to create spaces for collective expression through existing telecommunication infrastructures? At this juncture, how can we foster just and open forms of citizenship? What micro-politics and strategies of cohabitation are necessary to deploy ethical, tactical, and creative adaptations to the urbanization of these technologies? <h4> Space Junkies</h4> <h5> Team </h5> <p>Marie-Pier Boucher, Alice Jarry, Guillaume Pascale</p> <p> https://ars.electronica.art/who-owns-the-truth/en/space-junkies/ </p> <p> Around 230,036,500 pieces of debris orbit in space. Meanwhile, the 174 international exhibitors of the 2022 International Astronautical Congress (Paris) distributed thousands of stickers, tote bags, stress balls, car fresheners, space food and key chains. Attending these paralleling hoarding processes, Space Junkies examines how space debris and space goodies can ‘’forensically decode’’ (Schuppli, 2020) the capital and material accumulation of space exploration and its socio-environmental impacts.</p> <h4>Partition itératives, Space Junkies (with position data of the most dangerous space debris)</h4> <h5>Team</h5> <p>Guillaume Pacale, Marie-Pier Boucher, Alice Jarry</p><p> https://ars.electronica.art/who-owns-the-truth/en/events/partition-iteratives-space-junkies-with-position-data-of-the-most-dangerous-space-debris/</p> <p>Space Junkies examines how space debris and space goodies can ‘’forensically decode’’ (Schuppli, 2020) the capital and material accumulation of space exploration and its socio-environmental impacts.</p> <h4>Taking Communication to the next level</h4> <h5> team </h5> <p>Marie-Pier Boucher, Alice Jarry, Guillaume Pascale, lee wilkins</p> <p>architecturebiennalerotterdam2022.nl</p> <p>Vertical layering from various Google Earth views.
